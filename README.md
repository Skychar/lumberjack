Lumberjack JS
=============

Lumberjack hijacks the browser console and enhances it so logs can be split into more manageable chunks.

The Problem
-----------

Large browser based applications with lots of JavaScript need lots of logging. Unfortunately, the single stream logging built into modern web browsers gets very noisy as more and more events are logged. In can become difficult to even follow the logs. Lumberjack aims to fix that.
